if getting filezilla error message like => error while writing: received failure with description 'Failure'
Or
get blank file when open file from filezilla


1) it is becuase of aws ec2(EBS) storage volume limit exceeded for that need to modify volme limit 

2) go to aws console and select ec2 instance and copy Instance ID 

3) now go ELASTIC BLOCK STORE > Valumes then in search bar pase Instance ID

4) So you get the Volume attached with related instance

5) In this window search for ACTION tab click on it the you see Create Snapshot

6) Then check in Snapshot tab that your snapshot cretaed or not 

7) After that back again into Volumes

8) Then click on above Action tab then drop down open in that select "Modify Volume"

9) Then one popup screen open up in that search for " Size "  in that you can see your old size of volume 

10) Now change it with new size but remember that in Free Tier AWS  EC2 gives only 30Gb storage space if you need more then need to pay for that

11) Link for how to modify volume => https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Brbqkzqvjw
